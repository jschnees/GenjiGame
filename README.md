# GenjiGame

Whack-a-Genji is a game made for my CSCI2447 JavaScript Class.
Based on the Blizzard game Overwatch. https://playoverwatch.com/
We were tasked to create a "Whack a Mole style game using jQuery.

I did not create the artwork for this game, however the design and code are my own, as much as one can own code.
